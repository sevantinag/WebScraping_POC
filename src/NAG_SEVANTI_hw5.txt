1. What are the strengths of your data modeling format? 
- The strength of my data modeling is that it takes only the necessary numerical data value, and does not overload the processor or DB to insert value or retrieve values.

2. What are the weaknesses? (Does your data model support? Sorting the information? Re-ordering it? Only obtaining a certain subset of the information?) 
- My data model can only take in values that are in REAL or INT format. It is not able to take in numbers written in words like 'two' and convert it. My data model is also unable to store the organizations that were breach as it cannot segregate the org names from the tweets that are retrieved

3. How do you store your data on disk? 
- The data is stored in DB and the output graph is stored as a PNG

4. Let's say you find another data source that relates to all 3 of your data sources (i.e. a data source that relates to your existing data). How would you extend your model to include this new data source? How would that change the interface?
- If another data source is found, I would extend to check if the number of exposed data is included, and if so, the format of it. I would then include it to the DB in the 'DataBreaches' Table. The interface wouldn't change much except the final plotted graph would be changed

5. How would you add a new attribute to your data (i.e. imagine you had a lat/long column in a database. You might use that to access an API to get a city name. How would you add city name to your data?)
- I would like to add a new attribute that checks what industry does each Data Breach news belong to and see which industry is affected the most by the data breaches
